# Readme
You need to turn in a README file that describes the layout of the B-Tree file on
disk as well as any other relevant observations.


###### Progress Reports
Each team member is responsible for sending me, via email, a short progress report each
week. To clarify:
one progress report, per week, per member
A progress report should describe your project-related activities for the week. I expect each
team should have at least one meeting every week. Progress reports are confidential. So feel
comfortable reporting anything you think is important.
